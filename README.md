# cohort-analysis-using-Python

The goal of this project is to analyze the data to show the daily active users over the month, calculate the daily retention curve for the cohort of users who used the app for the first time on specific dates, and determine if there are any differences in usage based on where the users came from. I utilized NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries in Python to perform cohort analysis, visualized the insights and provided business recommendations.
